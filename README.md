# discord-translate-bot

A simple discord bot that translates messages using the Google Cloud Translation API.

## Installation

In order to run this bot, you need to have a [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/translate) account and a project with the Cloud Translation API enabled. You also need to have a Discord bot token. You can get one by creating a new bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

A `.env` file is required to run the bot. The file should contain the following variables:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_TOKEN=your_google_cloud_translation_api_token
# Optionally, you can change the log level
RUST_LOG=info # or debug, trace, etc.
```

You can install and run the bot by cloning the repository and running the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

To build a release version, run the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

You can then run the release version using the following command:

```bash
./target/release/discord_translate_bot
```
